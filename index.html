          May Ziadeh (1886–1941) was a renowned Arab writer, poet, and intellectual. Born in Nazareth, she became a
          central figure of the Arab literary Renaissance (Nahda), hosting a famous salon in Cairo that attracted
          leading thinkers of her time. Fluent in several languages, she published essays, poetry, and speeches
          advocating for women's rights and intellectual freedom. Despite personal losses and struggles with mental
